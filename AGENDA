* Welcome & outline
** Trifork
** Check abilities (functional coding? Erlang syntax?)
** The plan: to setup up and play with a distributed system (chatroom-ish)
* No-tamper promise

** Setup - software (Erlang; editor) & net

** Chat demo - presenting the chatroom, demoing the client
   - The chatroom protocol: {join,self()} + normal messages
   - (Publish-subscriber pattern)
** Chat note: about non-use of OTP
   - To keep it simple and focus on the language and core model
** Bot reading: echo_bot
   - A bit of Erlang syntax

** Free Play
   (Pair up if appropriate)
   Suggestions for things to do:
   - A monster bot for fighting with, with HP/respawn and stuff
   - Chatroom/chat client: join with names, show who says what
   - Chatroom: listing participants
   - Read some of the code
   - Dice bot  (simple or "roll 2d8")
   - Fight simulator (combat rules implementation)
   - Simple math: Primality tester; Fibonacci; ...
   - Storage bot (remember/recall/forget)
   - Grep bot


----------
Erlang essentials:
- Varibles vs. atoms
- Pattern matching

- Data are immutable
- Variables are single-assignment

- Strings are lists of charpoints (integers)
